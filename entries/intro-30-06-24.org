* Welcome to the blog

Hey!
Welcome to the blog! Finally after some time playing with different alternatives I think I have finally found a cool way to write and generate the blog

I have two main objectives with the blog:
- Share things I find interesting in case it can help anybody else
- Keep record on what I'm doing so I can come back at some point and enjoy what I wrote :)

This is not my first attempt on writing something. I wrote for a couple of years in [[https://zbutton.wordpress.com][this site]] (sorry it is in spanish), and I still enjoy going back and read myself from the past.

Nowadays I'm intested in Real Time Communications, Graphics Programming, Game developing, Linux, Emacs and AI, so expect the contents being related to this.

I hope you find something useful in here!
